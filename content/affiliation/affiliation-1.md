##### The Asian Jump Rope Union (AJRU) has become the 10th Asian Federation to gain GAISF Observer status

The decision was taken by the Global Association of Asian Sports Federations (GAISF) Council, which meting during SportAccord in Bangkok.
The AJRU was created by a merger of former rivals, the Asian Rope Skipping Federation (FISAC- IRSF) and World Jump Rope Federation (WJRF).
Both the constituent members of AJRU had made separate applications for Observer status but, in keeping with GAISFâ€™s commitment to accepting a single Asian Federation for each sport, both worked with the help of GAISF advisors to align their interests, overcome rivalry issues and create the new Federation.
Observer status allows Asian federations to be part of the GAISF network, take part in activities including the annual IF Forum and to attend the General Assembly, although they have no vote.
Observer status is the first step on a clear pathway for new Asian Federations towards the top of the Olympic Family pyramid. Those who wish to proceed will be assisted by GAISF, leading them into full GAISF membership through the Alliance of Independent Recognised Members of Sport (AIMS), and the Association of IOC Recognised Asian Sports Federations (ARISF).
