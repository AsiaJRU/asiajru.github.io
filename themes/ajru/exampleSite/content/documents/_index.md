### Constitution

------

This document has existed in many variations over the past year. It has received formal feedback from many Countries and has seen many changes. It represents a 'best effort' document which is consistent with other International Federations and focuses on what AJRU is trying to achieve in the longer term.

>This document enables AJRU to make a start in a new world order for our sport, and provides a framework of best practice to commence. Good luck reading it.... we hope you read it with the same intention it was written; "for the benefit of sport!"
