  content : "Since 1973 the competitive sport of jump rope/ skipping has made its indelible mark on the world of sports. 
  In that time the sport has experienced tremendous growth and development and has evolved into the Asian Jump Rope Union (AJRU), the sole Asian governing body of jump rope. 
  AJRU represents the merged Asian federations of Fédération Asian de Saut à la Corde - Asian Rope Skipping Federation (FISAC-IRSF) and the World Jump Rope Federation (WJRF). 
  Combined these two entities have produced 21 world championships.
  
  
  Today AJRU has a membership of 60 National Governing Bodies spanning five continents. We invite you to partner with AJRU by completing the partnership profile."
